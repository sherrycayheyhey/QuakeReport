        By defining the circle shape in XML, we create a single flexible asset that will
        scale across devices instead of including multiple image assets from our designer.
        We can also manipulate the color from Java code, further reducing the number of
        required assets. Fewer image files in our project means the size of our app will be
        smaller, which is better for the end user! See: https://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables
